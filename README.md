## Project Goal:
Develop state-of-the-art mobile robotics platfrom (AGV) targeting manufacturing businesses. Robot's electronic hardware must provide direct path for linear scalability from smaller systems all the way to the bigger robots. Same functionality modules can be stacked together on the ITX-style carrier board allowing to increase robot's capabilities.
